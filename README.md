# NetworkWhiteboadAssignment

Code files in src/whiteboard/

This assignment had two main parts: drawing on a whiteboard and then the communication between host and clients.
Used a GUI editing tool in Eclipse, then made the mistake of not moving the action listeners to their own section, so it's really messy :(.

This subject was the first time I used Java since 2013 though, so happy with how it turned out, just wish I had the headspace to better organise my code while relearning.
