# Network Whiteboad

## Goals

1. Create a program that could communicate over a network.
2. Create a program that has simple drawing functionality.

This was for a university assignment in 2022, to create a collaborative whiteboard program which had a host and multiple clients. Both would be able to draw using tools that were akin to some of the basics in MS Paint, as well as some simple chat functionality. The host could also save and load images.

## Technology
Java
- Swing toolkit for GUI creation

## Reflections
This subject was the first time I used Java since 2013 though, so happy with how it turned out, just wish I had the headspace to better organise my code while relearning.
